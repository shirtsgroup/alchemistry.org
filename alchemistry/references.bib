    abstract = "{We present a detailed comparison of computational efficiency and precision for several free energy difference (ΔF) methods. The analysis includes both equilibrium and nonequilibrium approaches, and distinguishes between unidirectional and bidirectional methodologies. We are primarily interested in comparing two recently proposed approaches, adaptive integration, and single-ensemble path sampling to more established methodologies. As test cases, we study relative solvation free energies of large changes to the size or charge of a Lennard-Jones particle in explicit water. The results show that, for the systems used in this study, both adaptive integration and path sampling offer unique advantages over the more traditional approaches. Specifically, adaptive integration is found to provide very precise long-simulation ΔF estimates as compared to other methods used in this report, while also offering rapid estimation of ΔF. The results demonstrate that the adaptive integration approach is the best overall method for the systems studied here. The single-ensemble path sampling approach is found to be superior to ordinary Jarzynski averaging for the unidirectional, “fast-growth” nonequilibrium case. Closer examination of the path sampling approach on a two-dimensional system suggests it may be the overall method of choice when conformational sampling barriers are high. However, it appears that the free energy landscapes for the systems used in this study have rather modest configurational sampling barriers.}",

Much attention has been placed on efficient ways to deal with the “endpoint singularity” effect that can cause simulation instabilities when changing the number of atoms. In this study we compare the performance of linear and several nonlinear transformation methods, among them separation shifted “soft core” scaling, for a popular test system, the hydration free energy of an amino acid side chain. All the nonlinear methods yield similar results if extensive sampling is performed, but soft core scaling provides smooth λ curves that are best suited for commonly used numerical integration schemes. Additionally, results from a more flexible solute, hexane, will also be discussed.}",

They provide a simple interpretation of ‘‘moment of inertia correction’’ and ‘‘dynamic stretch free energy’’ terms in such simulations. Since the relevant Jacobian factors can often be evaluated analytically by use of the configurational partition function of a polyatomic molecule, it is possible to subtract them from the simulation results when they make unphysical contributions. An important case arises in alchemical simulations that use a single topology method and introduce dummy particles to have the same number of atoms in the initial and final state. The more general utility of the Jacobian factors for simulations of complex systems is briefly discussed.}",
