Because free energy is a state function, we can construct a [[Thermodynamic_Cycle|thermodynamic path]] that takes us through a set of states that improves phase space overlap between states.

This is usually brought on by the $r^{-12}$ term that appears in Lennard-Jones based potentials and is present at all nonzero values of $\\lambda$. Since most the free energy techniques require some numeric methods, evaluating this singularity diverges the calculations.\n",

    "## Avoid turning off charges and Lennard-Jones sites at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "Guideline 2 states that a partial atomic charge should never be allowed to remain on an atom while its Lennard-Jones interactions are being removed. To understand the reason for this, consider two atoms of opposite charge, A and B. Lennard-Jones interactions of atom A are being scaled back. Regardless of the scaling scheme used, at some lambda value, atoms A and B will begin to overlap occasionally, since the final state allows A and B to overlap totally. If A has a remaining partial atomic charge when these overlaps become possible, the two point charges assigned to A and B can actually overlap as well. Since the potential energy of Coulomb interactions between point charges scales as $q_{A} q_{B}/r_{AB}$, where $r_{AB}$ is the distance between A and B, this presents significant problems when $q_A$ and $q_B$ have opposite signs. In particular, there is an infinite energy minimum at $r_{AB}=0$, so the two particles would in principle get trapped on top of one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, what usually happens in molecular dynamics simulations in these circumstances is that the forces get extremely large as A and B begin to overlap, and the simulation will crash. Constraint algorithms are often the first to fail, so this may lead to a warning about constraints (i.e. LINCS or SHAKE) and then a crash. This issue is discussed briefly by Pitera and van Gunsteren{{cite|Pitera2002}} and in more detail by Anwar and Heyes{{cite|Anwar2005}}.\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of this problem, we recommend always turning off partial charges for any atoms for which Lennard-Jones interactions are being removed before doing the Lennard-Jones transformation. Additionally, when Lennard-Jones parameters for an atom are being substantially modified during a free energy calculation (i.e. for relative free energy calculations involving mutation of an atom) and soft-core potentials are employed, similar problems may arise, so it may be useful to remove partial charges on atoms which are being mutated, as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several groups have developed modified electrostatics scaling methods in an attempt to bypass this problem and allow electrostatics interactions and Lennard-Jones interactions to be turned off in only one set of calculations (for example, Anwar and Heyes{{cite|Anwar2005}}), but since electrostatics transformations are usually so smooth a function of $\\lambda$ and need only few $\\lambda$ values for good overlap (Shirts et al.{{cite|Shirts2005}} 2005], Mobley et al.{{cite|Mobley2007}}, and others) it is unclear that this results in any significant efficiency gain over performing the transformations separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in Guideline 2, above, electrostatics transformations are typically smooth functions of lambda with good phase-space overlap between even coarsely-spaced lambda values(Shirts et al.{{cite|Shirts2005}} 2005], Mobley et al.{{cite|Mobley2007}}, and others). As a consequence, these are quite efficient compared to Lennard-Jones calculations. As established above, when particles are being inserted or deleted, the electrostatic interactions of these particles should be set to zero before turning off their Lennard-Jones interactions. But what about electrostatic interactions on atoms which are merely being mutated (i.e. a change of partial charge and Lennard-Jones radius), as in relative free energy calculations?\n",
    "We are not aware of any study which has looked at this in detail, but given the efficiency of free energy calculations modifying electrostatics interactions relative to those significantly modifying Lennard-Jones interactions, we believe it makes sense to perform the two sets of calculations separately. Given that the two transformations have different lambda-dependences, it might actually be less efficient to perform them together than separately. Performing them separately has an additional advantage, as well: Uncertainties in the two components can be assessed separately, and computational effort focused on reducing the largest uncertainty (i.e. by extending some simulations to get additional sampling).\n",
    "Further testing should be focused in this area, to determine whether alternative scaling approaches which can modify Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions simultaneously{{cite|Anwar2005}} are actually more efficient than the approach of separate modification that we propose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of this, our recommendation is that either (a) partial charges on any particles being inserted or deleted be turned off prior to the use of soft core potentials for those particles, or (b) a soft core scheme for electrostatics be implemented to allow simultaneous changes."

    "1. **Bonded terms can be modified/turned off linearly.** This includes angle or bond force constants as well as *unconstrained* bond distances.\n",

    "1. **Maximize similarity between states by removing/decoupling as few atoms as possible.**\n",
    "1. ** Do not open and close rings.** This supersedes the previous rule.\n",
    "1. **Statistical uncertainty between any neighboring states should be equal.** Rather challenging to do, but it has been proven to have the lowest variance path if you can pull it off.{{cite|Shenfeld2009}}\n",
    "1. **Deleting or adding atoms should always be done with a soft core potential.**\n",
    "1. ***Changes* in parameters can be done linearly.**\n",
    "1. **All charge on atoms must be turned off prior to atomic repulsion.** Otherwise you can get an infinite attractive potential and crash your simulation. \n",
    "    * Similarly for only changes in terms, it's generally **more efficient to change electrostatic terms separate from Lennard-Jones terms.**\n",
    "1. **More states is better than fewer.** Variance shrinks rapidly with number of states. You want the difference between intermediaries to be between 2-3 $k_BT$. Obviously you will be limited on CPU power. Fewer states also leads to more samples begin required from each state, so take this into account when deciding number of states as well.  However, for MBAR and TI, it can be shown that spreading samples across multiple states does not significantly affect the uncertainty, since for TI, each state contributes less to the total uncertainty, and in MBAR, data contributes to the statistical precision of states with similar values of lambda.\n",
    "1. **Shape of the variance does not significantly change with number of atoms, only magnitude.**{{cite|Shirts2003}} More intermediates will still be required for a large number of atoms to reduce statistical noise. \n",
    "1. **Charge should be maintained across all $\\lambda$.** Simply *having* charged molecules is fine, but the net of the system should remain constant. If you must change the net charge, there are complicated ways to do so.{{cite|Kastenholz2006a}}{{cite|Kastenholz2006b}}\n",
    "1. **Short prototype simulations are recommended.** Even as short as 100 ps, the prototypes can provide rough magnitude of variance estimates, although will likely under-predict the free energy as many configurations remain unsampled."

D represents non-interacting dummies, while M represents nonphysical intermediate atoms. In a dual topology approach, no atoms change type, only have their interactions turned off from the rest of the system; however, more atoms need to be altered to go from the initial to the final state.

    "After the intermolecular forces are decided, you will then need to decide the overall method in which you will modify your molecules. There are two main approaches known as the *single topology* approach and the *dual topology* approach; examples of this can be seen in the figure to the side which will be referenced accordingly. Single topology (A, upper) has only one site for any location shared between the end states, and then \"dummy\" atoms to make up for any unique sites. During the transformation, the dummy atoms are transformed into fully interacting atoms, and the shared site atom is transformed directly to a new atom. Dual topology (B, lower) is different in that shared sites between states do **not** share atoms.  No atom changes its type, just the interactions with the surrounding system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dual topology does require more dummies, which means more CPU power and needed intermediates, however, it has a very strong advantage in that the dummies can simultaneously explore more congregational space while decoupled; this perk is amplified when simulations are run with Hamiltonian exchange or expanded ensemble. One may notice that, even though the dummies have nonbonded interactions, they are still \"bound\" to other atoms which make the end states have slightly nonphysical character. These interactions though can be accounted for by simulating in both vacuum and in molecular surrounds. With fixed bond lengths in the rigid rotor approximation, the effect of these dummies on the free energy is negated.{{cite|Boresch1999}} If the bonds are not constrained, there is a difference, but not enough to be of concern (>0.01 kcal/mol).\n",
    "\n",
    "In either topology, it may also be necessary to modify the bonded terms (especially for angle and dihedral terms). Because of the time scale of these motions, these terms converge quickly leaving one with small variances but large energy changes. For simple bonded parameters like harmonic spring constants and equilibrium bond lengths, linear changes are perfectly acceptable. *Constrained* bonds are challanging to compute as correction terms are needed from the complete lack of phase space overlap{{cite|Boresch2003}}\n",

As such, rings should be disappeared entirely and the new molecule appeared if you find the need to actually break the ring, and in reverse for appearing the ring. This has been shown to be straightforward with the soft core potentials and is still accurate despite the large number of transformations.{{cite|Shirts2005}}{{cite|Shirts2003}}{{cite|Mobley2007}}{{cite|Nicholls2008}}{{cite|Mobley2009}}\n",

Carrying these out can be done with either [[Methods and Simulation Workflow|nonequilibrium methods]],{{cite|Ytreberg2009}}  or by setting up an umbrella simulation with different overlapping harmonic oscillators at increasing distances from the binding pocket, then calculating the PMF.{{cite|Lee2006}}{{cite|Woo2005}}{{cite|Gan2008}}\n",
