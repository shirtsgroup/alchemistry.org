    "Thermodynamic Integration (TI) is one of the most common methods for calculating free energy differences, and the easiest to understand. The basic relationship can be calculated by taking the derivative of the free energy difference with respect to $\\lambda$. It is one of the few methods that require calculation of $\\frac{\\partial U(\\lambda,\\vec{q})}{\\partial\\lambda}$. The need to calculate the derivative is also one of its limitations as many simulation packages will not calculate this natively, and can cause problems when numerically evaluating it at $r = 0$. Despite this, it is still one of the most accurate methods if used correctly and it is generally recommended for those new to the field because of its simplicity and ease of use if available in your code of interest."

    "## Estimating Free Energies with TI\n",
    "The above derivation makes it rather simple to estimate free energies from TI as there is no iterative solution needed, and information from only a single state is needed to calculate the derivative.

We recommend starting users in free energy calculations use the trapezoid rule as it is very straightforward and maximizes flexibility in choice of $\\lambda$ spacing. Under the trapezoid rule, even lambda spacing weights are $\\displaystyle w_1 = w_k = 1/[2(K-1)]$ and $w_{k \\ne 1,K} = 1/(K-1)$. Other weighting schemes have also been tried but are not recommended for beginners as they each have their own benefits and disadvantages and are often system specific. {{Cite|Jorge2010}}{{Cite|Shyu2009}}  The worst case scenario is that you have to run a few extra intermediate states to get accurate results."

    "The statistical error TI is fairly straightforward to calculate, but has one catch beginners should be aware of. Although the information required to calculate $\\left\\langle \\frac{dU}{d\\lambda} \\right\\rangle$ requires information from only the one state, to calculate the free energy over single interval takes values from two or more states at a time, which means that the statistical error over the entire interval does **not add independently.**\n",

    "## Problems with TI\n",
    "Although TI is one of the simplest free energy methods to analyze, it also suffers from some drawbacks that need to be carefully avoided. For instance, if the curvature of $\\frac{dU}{d\\lambda}$ is large, the bias introduced by discrete $\\lambda$ states becomes significant. So when using TI it is very important that researchers verify that they have gathered data from sufficient numbers of states, such that the free energy becomes independent of the number of states to within statistical precision."

    "which is acceptable for changes in parameters, but not for annihilating or decoupling a site because of the $r^{-12}$ term in the Lennard-Jones potentials in $U_i$. The linear transformation will always have an infinite potential at $r=0$ leading to numeric instabilities for evaluating {{#tag:math | {{dudl}} }} in TI. Although there are ways to get around this, they do not converge very well with any function of $\\lambda$ taking the form shown above. However, if one were to use a [[Intermediate States#Soft Core Potentials | soft core potential]], this problem can be mostly avoided."

    "### Modifying Simulations\n",
    "Because most other free energy methods do not need to evaluate {{#tag:math | {{dudl}} }}, many simulation codes do not natively support evaluating this quantity. If the thermodynamic path is constructed with a [[Intermediate States|linear transformation]], then the derivative can be evaluated in post-processing knowing the energy of the system. However, if the transformation is done with [[Intermediate States#Soft Core Potentials | soft core potentials]], then the derivative will need to be evaluated in code, and it will often be necessary for researchers to modify the code in-house as many simulation packages do not evaluate this quantity.  It would probably better to use another method if the derivative is not explicitly calculated."
