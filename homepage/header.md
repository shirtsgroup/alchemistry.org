# What is Alchemistry?
Alchemical free energy calculations employ unphysical ("alchemical") intermediates to estimate the free energies of 
various physical processes. Such process include ligand binding to a protein receptor, the transfer of a small molecule 
from gas to water, or the free energy of a mutation of a side chain. This approach provides not only a quantitative and 
rigorous method for computing free energies, but often provides insight into the dominant interactions driving binding.
